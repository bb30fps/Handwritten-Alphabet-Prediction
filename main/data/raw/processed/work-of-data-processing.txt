Raw CSV → Load → Reshape → Normalize → Encode Labels → Train/Test Split → Save Processed Data

Input/Output Paths:

Auto Input: Always reads from data/raw/A_Z Handwritten Data.csv

Auto Output: Saves processed data to:

data/processed/
├── train_data.npz (training set)
└── test_data.npz (test set)
2. Automatic Processing:

Runs with one command:

bash
python src/data_processing.py
Automatically:

Creates processed directory if missing

Converts 784-pixel CSV rows → 28x28x1 images

Normalizes pixels (0-1 range)

Encodes labels (0-25 → one-hot vectors)

Splits data (80% train / 20% test)

Saves as compressed numpy files

3. Self-Contained Workflow
No manual file operations needed after placing the raw CSV in the specified location.
